### **Screenshot 2: Frontend Application Working**

1. Open your browser

- Follow "Troubleshooting" section below

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting: If Frontend Doesn't Show Movies**

The frontend needs to be rebuilt with the correct backend URL:

### **Step 1: Verify Backend URL Secret**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/Mohammeddomzi/Project4/settings/secrets/actions`
2. Check `BACKEND_URL` value should be:
   ```
   a66d8d8f200a24c31b1a64e62f705ccc-910932871.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
   ```
   (NO `http://` prefix!)

### **Step 2: If Secret is Wrong, Update It**

1. Click pencil icon next to `BACKEND_URL`
2. Update value to: `a66d8d8f200a24c31b1a64e62f705ccc-910932871.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
3. Click "Update secret"

### **Step 3: Redeploy Frontend**

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\React Projects\Project4"
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b frontend-final-deploy
echo "<!-- Final deployment -->" >> starter/frontend/public/index.html
git add .
git commit -m "Final: Deploy frontend with correct backend URL"
git push -u origin frontend-final-deploy
```

Then:

1. Create PR on GitHub
2. Wait for CI to pass
3. Merge PR
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for CD to complete
5. Refresh frontend URL in browser
6. Take screenshot!
